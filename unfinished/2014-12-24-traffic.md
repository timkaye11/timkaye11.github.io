title: Traffic in Singapore
---

while visiting my parents in singapore, i noticed that drivers in singapore are really bad. better yet, when the rain really starts to pick up, the standard of driving drops to a new low. as it is currently the middle of the rainy season (december - february) i wondered if there was any direct relationship between the poor driving and other factors - such as rainfall. also, i wondered if drivers in singapore were statistically 'worse' than drivers in rainy states in the US such as seattle and oregon. :umbrella:

lucky for me, the city-state of singapore provides an excellent API for traffic incidents, road conditions, ERP (toll) fees, and locations of various entities. more information is available [here](http://data.gov.sg/common/developer.aspx).

to visualize the data, i used [leaflet in r](http://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/), a new package released by rstudio.
